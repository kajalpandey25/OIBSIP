## Task Details

### Task 1: Calculator App

In this task, I developed a calculator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The interface is user-friendly and responsive.

### Task 2: Tribute Page - Steve Jobs

For the second task, I created a tribute page dedicated to Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. The page provides information about Dr. Ambedkar's life, achievements, and contributions. It includes a visually appealing design and relevant content to honor his significant impact.
